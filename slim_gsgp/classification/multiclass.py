Independent-coordinate multiclass MS-SLIM (integration plan, phase M1;
MS_SLIM_formulation.md, section 10, reference implementation).

Evolves K-1 independent SLIM programs, one per simplex coordinate, each
trained with ``code_regression_loss`` against that coordinate of the true
class's code. Prediction picks the class whose code is closest to the
stacked output.

Each coordinate's target is a continuous simplex-code value (e.g. 0.5 or
-0.866, not +-1), so the binary squared-hinge ``margin_loss`` does not apply
per coordinate -- formulation section 5's margin ``m_ik`` is a joint quantity
across all K-1 coordinates together, not something with a per-coordinate
hinge form. ``code_regression_loss`` is the formulation-sanctioned baseline
(section 14, Question 2) that regresses each coordinate directly onto its
code value instead.

This means M1 is a plain-regression approximation of MS-SLIM's prediction
rule and class geometry, not its margin objective -- the margin/hinge
structure only exists once coordinates are coupled, which requires the
shared-block representation of phase M2. State this when reporting results
(see integration plan, section 4, phase M1).

No core SLIM files are touched -- this runs plain ``slim()`` K-1 times.
