Shared-block multiclass MS-SLIM (integration plan phase M2;
MS_SLIM_formulation.md, section 10).

Represents the full semantic output as ``P(x) = sum_b r_b(x) * a_b``, so on the
training set ``S = R^T A`` where ``R`` is the (B, n) matrix of scalar block
semantics and ``A`` is the (B, K-1) matrix of block coefficient vectors. Each
symbolic block contributes one rank-one semantic matrix.

Unlike the independent-coordinate reference (``classification.multiclass``),
this optimizes the **joint** margin objective of formulation section 5, in which
the hinge terms couple all K-1 coordinates through ``m_ik``. One shared set of
symbolic blocks serves every class.

Implementation note: a SLIM ``Individual`` already stores exactly ``R`` in
``train_semantics``, shape (B, n) -- one scalar semantic vector per block. So no
new individual representation is needed: the blocks are evolved by the stock
``inflate``/``deflate`` operators, and only the coefficient matrix ``A`` is
added on top. ``A`` is fitted by minimizing the joint loss, which is convex in
``A`` because ``S`` is linear in it (formulation section 11).

    Fit the block coefficient matrix ``A`` for fixed block semantics ``R``.

    ``S = R^T A`` is linear in ``A`` and the joint margin loss is strictly
    convex in ``S``, so the composed problem is convex in ``A`` and gradient
    descent reaches its global optimum (formulation section 11). Uses Adam
    rather than a hand-rolled active-set solve: the multiclass hinge has
    ``n * (K-1)`` breakpoints instead of the ``n`` of the binary case, which
    makes an exact sweep considerably more involved for no accuracy gain on a
    convex objective.
