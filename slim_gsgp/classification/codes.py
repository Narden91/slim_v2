"""
Label encoding/decoding for margin-based classification (MS-SLIM).

Binary classification is the K=2 case of the simplex-code formulation
(MS_SLIM_formulation.md, section 7), so its codes are hardcoded here as
``{-1, +1}`` rather than generated from a general K-class simplex routine
that this repo does not otherwise need yet (see integration plan section 0,
anti-duplication rule 4).

_POS, _NEG = 1.0, -1.0


def encode_binary(y: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Encode arbitrary two-valued labels as ``{-1, +1}``.

    The larger of the two distinct values in ``y`` is mapped to ``+1`` and
    the smaller to ``-1`` (so ``{0, 1}`` labels map the usual way, with
    ``1 -> +1``). Already-encoded ``{-1, +1}`` input is returned unchanged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : torch.Tensor
        Labels with exactly two distinct values.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Float tensor with values in ``{-1.0, +1.0}``.

def encode_zero_one(y: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Encode arbitrary two-valued labels as ``{0, 1}``, for sigmoid-based losses.

    The counterpart of ``encode_binary`` for strategies whose loss expects
    ``{0, 1}`` targets (``sigmoid_rmse``). Without this, passing ``{-1, +1}``
    labels to such a strategy trains a sigmoid output, bounded in ``[0, 1]``,
    against a ``-1`` target: the minimum is unreachable, and nothing raises.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : torch.Tensor
        Labels with exactly two distinct values.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Float tensor with values in ``{0.0, 1.0}``.

    Prediction rule from MS_SLIM_formulation.md, section 2: ``sign(P(x))``,
    with the convention that ``P(x) == 0`` is assigned to the positive class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_pred : torch.Tensor
        Raw semantics from a trained individual.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor

    Built from the rows of a (K-1)-dimensional regular simplex: unit norm,
    pairwise inner product -1/(K-1), and they sum to zero. For K=2 this
    reduces to the {-1, +1} codes used by binary margin_loss (formulation
    section 7).

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_classes : int
        Number of classes K, at least 2.
