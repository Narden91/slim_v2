Fitness functions for margin-based classification (MS-SLIM) and the raw-score
baselines needed to isolate its effect (MS_SLIM_formulation.md, section 14).

All of these operate directly on raw SLIM semantics -- no sigmoid or softmax
is inserted -- and follow the same factory convention as
``slim_gsgp.evaluators.fitness_functions.sigmoid_rmse``: a hyperparameter
constructor returns a ``(y_true, y_pred) -> torch.Tensor`` callable with a
descriptive ``__name__`` for logging.
