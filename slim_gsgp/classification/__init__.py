Classification utilities for SLIM_GSGP.

Two families of technique are available, chosen via
``slim_gsgp.main_slim.slim(fitness_function=...)``:

- **Sigmoid + RMSE** (Bakurov et al. 2022): squashes raw outputs through a
  sigmoid before comparing to {0,1} labels. Kept for backward compatibility;
  see ``slim_gsgp.evaluators.fitness_functions.sigmoid_rmse``.
- **MS-SLIM / margin loss** (this module): evaluates classification loss
  directly on raw semantics, with a squared-hinge margin term. See
  ``MS_SLIM_formulation.md`` for the full derivation.

The recommended entry point is ``get_strategy(name)``, which returns a
``ClassificationStrategy`` binding the label encoding, fitness function, and
prediction decoding that belong together for a given technique -- so you
cannot accidentally decode margin-loss semantics with a sigmoid threshold,
or vice versa.

Example
-------
>>> from slim_gsgp.classification import get_strategy
>>> from slim_gsgp.main_slim import slim
>>> strategy = get_strategy("margin")
>>> y_train_encoded = strategy.encode(y_train)
>>> model = slim(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train_encoded,
...               fitness_function=strategy.fit_string, lam=0.01)
>>> y_pred = strategy.decode(model.predict(X_test))
